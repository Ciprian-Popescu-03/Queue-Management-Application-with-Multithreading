Task Management App 📝

Welcome to the Task Management App, a desktop application developed with Java.
Its purpose is to help a software company's project manager manage employee tasks efficiently, estimate work durations, and monitor task completion — all through a simple and user-friendly Java Swing interface.

Description 📖

Upon opening the app, the project manager is greeted with a GUI that allows them to:
