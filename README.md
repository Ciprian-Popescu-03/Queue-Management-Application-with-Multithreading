# Queue Management Simulation App üñ•Ô∏è

Welcome to the **Queue Management Simulation App**, a desktop application developed with **Java Swing**.
Its purpose is to simulate a queue management system for a set of clients and servers, allowing users to experiment with different scheduling strategies and observe real-time simulation logs in a graphical interface.

---

# Description üìñ

Upon opening the app, users are greeted with a GUI that allows them to:

* **Set Simulation Parameters**: Number of clients, number of queues, simulation interval, and client arrival/service time ranges.
* **Start Simulation**: Begin the simulation with the chosen parameters.
* **View Real-Time Logs**: Monitor client arrivals, queue assignments, and service completions in a live log area.
* **Run Test Cases**: Optionally execute predefined test simulations for evaluation purposes.

Simulation behavior is managed by the **SimulationManager**, which handles client dispatching and queue management using the selected scheduling policy.

# Features ü™Ñ

* **Simulation Parameter Input**: Customize number of clients, queues, simulation time, and service/arrival ranges.
* **Real-Time Logging**: Live updates displayed in a scrollable text area within the GUI.
* **Scheduling Strategies**: Supports policies like **Shortest Time** for client assignment.
* **Multithreaded Simulation**: Each simulation runs in a separate thread, ensuring responsive GUI.
* **Test Cases**: Predefined test simulations with different client and queue configurations.
* **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple, intuitive layout using **Java Swing**.
